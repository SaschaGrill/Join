                <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                <p> In principle, pending tasks can be managed and processed more easily with Join.
                    It is possible to assign employees to specific tasks.
                    It is particularly helpful to divide extensive tasks into subtasks and thus make the progress
                    visible to
                    everyone.
                    Tasks can be provided with an expiry date and a priority, so that particularly urgent tasks are
                    immediately in
                    focus.
                    Of course, all tasks can also be edited afterwards. The board provides an overview of all tasks and
                    their
                    processing status.
                    Tasks can be moved between the different processing statuses using drag and drop.
                    After logging in, the user can immediately see all tasks and their status.
                    New contacts can easily be created in the contacts-section.
                </p>
